      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>After receiving my B. S. in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University in 2014, I decided to pursue a career in technology consulting at CS Technology.

    At CS Technology, I had the amazing opportunity to work on multiple different clients such as Affinion Group, Target, AQR capital and others. Not only did I gain valuable client management and project management experience at this company, but I also gained experience helping the company grow with internal business analytics using tools such as Qlikview and ITI Salesforce.

    I created this website to document and display my past projects; whether they may be academic or in my profession.

    But more importantly, I created this website to keep track and motivate myself to what else I can accomplish.
